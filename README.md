# This is UniversalLegoController

Universal Lego Controller or UniCon is a ESP32 arduino program for the UniCon board.
It allows you to control multiple Lego Powered UP blocks (including technic hub, boost, duplo train, etc) as well as older Infrared Power Functions recievers.

This project is intended to be opened with Visual Studio Code with Platform IO extension.
But you should be able to use Arduino IDE as well with small modifications.

You'll need to install all required dependencies before compiling this project.
